# Compleat - A todo-list iOS app

## Description

`Compleat` is a simple and intuitive todo list app designed to simplify your tasks.

With Compleat, you can easily create and manage your daily tasks, set reminders, and prioritize your work. Compleat is built using the latest technologies and frameworks, including UserNotifications, UIKit, and persisting data with a plist file.

## Technologies

Compleat is built using the following technologies:

* `UIKit` for designing the app's interface and user experience.
* `User Notifications` for scheduling and sending notifications to the user when a task is due.
* `Data Persistance` serializing user data to Plist files
* `UserDefaults` to remember last open list

## Features

* Implementing data persistence to store tasks across multiple app launches
* Handling edge cases such as incomplete or missing task data
* Implementing reminders and notifications for upcoming tasks and deadlines
* Enabling sorting and filtering of tasks by priority, due date, or other criteria

## Skills Gained

Developing this todo list app helped solidify a variety of iOS skills, including:

* `User Interface Design` Creating an intuitive and visually appealing interface that allows users to interact with tasks and task lists effectively.
* `Data Persistence` Using a variety of techniques to store task data locally on the device, such as using Core Data, a plist file, or other data storage technologies.
