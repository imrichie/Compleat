# My List

## Description

**My List** is an iOS application that let's you create all kinds of lists and customize it with icons and set reminders to notify you of your most important tasks.

This app let's you organize items into lists and then check off these items once you've completed them. You can also set a reminder that will make the iPhone pop up an alert on the specified due date taking advantage of local notifications from the User Notifications framework.

My intent with this app was to showcase my skills building a dynamic application with features and standard iOS controls.

## Tools and Frameworks

* UIKit
* User Notifications
* UINavigationController
* UITableViewController
* Data Persistance - serializing user data to Plist files
* UserDefaults to remember last open list
