# My List

## Description

**My List** is a to-do list manager for busy individuals letting users streamline their personal tasks into organized lists. Get notified every time with notifications so you'll always be on top of your tasks and be more effective.

This app let's you organize items into lists and then check off these items once you've completed them. You can also set a reminder that will make the iPhone send an alert on the specified due date taking advantage of local notifications from the *User Notifications* framework.

My intent with this app was to showcase my skills building a dynamic application with features and standard iOS controls.

## Tools and Frameworks

* UIKit
* User Notifications
* UINavigationController
* UITableViewController
* Data Persistance - serializing user data to Plist files
* UserDefaults to remember last open list
